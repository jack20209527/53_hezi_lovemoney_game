                        <h3>About Curve Rush
Curve Rush challenges you to fly above the line and score points, but beware! The higher you get, the harder the landing will be. Keep it smooth and avoid crashing! Welcome to Curve Rush, a thrilling running game, where you control a ball sliding over endless sand dunes, making extraordinary jumps, and earning your highest points. However, be aware, it’s not that easy! The game can end at any time if you lose focus. Just a crash, and you’ll have to start over.

All About Curve Rush
Released in February 2025, Curve Rush is a single-player arcade game developed by Azgames.io. In the game, players take control of a ball with the primary objective of traveling as far as possible while maintaining smooth momentum and performing high jumps for extra points. The more high jumps you have, the higher scores you earn. Though it may sound simple, you may quickly find it's tough to jump high into the sky while keeping the ball safe. Remember, landing too hard will instantly end the run.

How to Play Curve Rush
The game begins with the ball rolling on a series of dunes. Holding down the spacebar (on desktops PC) or your screen (on mobile devices) makes the ball accelerate, increasing momentum. Releasing at the right moment allows the ball to launch into the air.
Jumping above the white line at the top of the screen earns you +1 point. The key to gaining scores involves jumping above the line while keeping control of the landing. A well-timed release on an upward slope propels the ball so high into the air and gets you precious scores. However, please note that risky jumps make controlled landings more difficult.
Harsh landings or hitting a peak too fast can end the game. So, be sure to land gently on a downward slope for smooth landings. Releasing at the right moment also helps reduce the descent speed of the ball.
Coins are scattered along the run. Collect and use them to unlock new skins and environments. In total, there are 30 different skins and 8 unique themes/environments for you to explore.

Game Controls
- Mouse clicks
- Space key
- Up arrow key

Conquer Four Unique Cups with 35 Challenging Levels
In addition to the endless running mode, Curve Rush also features four distinct cups, each offering 35 levels filled with exciting challenges. Each level features a specific mission to complete before reaching the finish line.
Also, what sets these cups apart is the unique world setting in each one. The terrain and perspective shift dynamically, placing your character in different orientations. As you join these modes, you may find yourself navigating above or below the hills, or even experiencing a full 180-degree flip to the left. This ever-changing perspective, without a doubt, adds an extra layer of difficulty and excitement.
This way, the game maintains fresh and engaging gameplay as you adapt to new environments. Join now and see if you can conquer huge challenges through all 140 levels.

How to Get the Highest Scores in Curve Rush?
- Aim for consecutive smooth landings: Two or more smooth landings in a row give you bonus points, so aim for combo moves to maximize your scores.
- Collect coins strategically: Focusing on gathering coins along the way may disrupt your trajectory. Instead, target coin clusters that align with your path to maintain smooth movements.
- Avoid oversteering: Remember, the game ends instantly after harsh landings, and you can’t earn any more points. Thus, avoid making sharp or sudden turns that can cause crashes. Instead, use smooth, gradual movements to navigate curves efficiently.

Game Features
- Different themes and environments to explore
- A huge collection of skins to equip
- Engaging sliding and jumping gameplay
- Cool physics of landing
- 4 Unique cups with dozens of challenging levels
